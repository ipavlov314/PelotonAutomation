# PelotonAutomation

In this repo, we'll explore questions like whether to cover certain cases with UI or Unit Tests, <br>
&emsp; who's responsible for coverage, 
and delve into writing testable SwiftUI code. <br>

> Considering that `some View` isn't testable for unit tests, isn't it? 

## RoadMap
- You will find a couple of branches: `main` with the basic setup code, [unitTests](https://github.com/ipavlov314/PelotonAutomation/tree/unitTests) and [uiTests](https://github.com/ipavlov314/PelotonAutomation/tree/uiTests) branches.
- I suggest taking some time to explore the 'main' branch. Consider how will you test the scenarios added in the PelotonAutomationUITests file.
- Next, you can check the 'unitTests' branch to see how the MVVM pattern improved the initial implementation, making the code testable for unit tests. Additionally, you will find unit test implementations.
- Finally, the third branch should serve as the final step to evaluate what exactly UI tests should cover.
